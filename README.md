# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the branch that deals with the design,development and maintenance of applications
its importance is that it reduces complexity

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of software engineering-marked the recognition of software development as a formal engineering discipline
The Agile manifesto-was created to shift focus heavy documentation processes to more adaptive and people centric methodologies
devOps integration-aim to streamline processes and accelerate software delivery

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning-projects are gathered and a project is outlined. this phase sets the foundation for the project
Analysis-the goal is to understand the project scope and define system requirements
Desing-desinging documents that guide the development process
Implementations-developers wrrite the code and test it to ensure it meets the requirements
Testing-systematicallythe software for dbugs,defects and ensuringit meets the quality of the standards
Deployment-releasing the software to end users and ensuring a smooth transition from delopment to live operation
Maintenance-it includes fixing bugs,adding new features and ensuring the software remains functional

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
